# Mod Sand Source

# This is the preferred sand source file for custom elements and
# interactions. This file is loaded in std.sand, so you can use and
# reference the standard elements.
#
# See resources/doc/sandsrc for the language documentation.
#
# External mods should be installed in the 'sandsrc/mods' directory
# and included from here.
